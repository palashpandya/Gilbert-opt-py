<h1>FINDING THE CLOSEST SEPARABLE STATE</h1>
<h2>USING GILBERT'S ALGORITHM</h2>

<p>
  The separability problem is an NP-HARD problem, and one of the most fundamental in Quantum Information science.
  Given a density matrix, one would like to find out if the described quantum state is Entangled or separable.
  Gilbert Algorithm is applied here to tackle this problem  by minimizing the HIlbert-Schmidt distance of a given state from the set of separable states.
